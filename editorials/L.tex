The trick is to select the unhappiness score of someone and count how many times that score appear
in the top K values. We can keep a DP state $(bit\_mask, bigger\_scores\_count, selected\_score\_appeared)$.
Basically we will put people one after another, everytime calculating their unhappiness score. If the 
score is smaller than the selected score then we ignore it. If the score is bigger then $bigger\_scores\_count$
is incremented by one. If the score is the same is the selected score then we can consider it as bigger or 
mark $selected\_score\_appeared$ as $true$. This DP will have the complexity of $O(2^n\cdot n^3)$. With some
other minor optimizations, this runs reasonably fast.
