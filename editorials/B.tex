We know that $x \& y \le \min(x, y)$ and it looks like $\gcd(x, y) \le \min(x, y)$.

So $\gcd(x \oplus y, x \& y) \le \min(x \oplus y, x \& y) \le \min(x, y)$.

Also notice that $i$ can be equal to $j$, so it looks like the answer is $\max({a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n})$ because this is the maximum possible $\gcd$.

But this is wrong due to the case when $x = 0$ or $y = 0$ because then $\gcd(x, y) = x$ when $y = 0$ and $\gcd(x, y) = y$ when $x = 0$.

So when $a_i \oplus a_j = 0$, we have $a_i = a_j$, so $\gcd(a_i \oplus a_j, a_i \& a_j) = \gcd(0, a_i \& a_i) = \gcd(0, a_i) = a_i$.
So for this case we need to take care of the maximum number of the array only.

And when $a_i \& a_j = 0$, we have $a_i \oplus a_j = a_i + a_j$ because there is no common bit in $a_i$ and $a_j$
so xor and addition are the same in this case.

So we need to find the maximum $a_i + a_j$ where $a_i \& a_j = 0$. So let's fix $a_i$
and then find the maximum $a_j$ such that $a_i \& a_j = 0$ which means we 
need to find the maximum $a_j$ such that $a_j$ is a submask of the flipped bits of $a_i$.

Finding the maximum submask of a mask that exists in the array is a standard problem that can be solved
using Sum Over Subsets (SOS) DP. We can also find the count of such submasks using the same DP.

So overall we need to consider the maximum element of the array and the maximum sum of two elements such that there is no common bit between them.

Time Complexity: $O(m \cdot 2^m)$ where $m$ is the number of bits in the maximum element of the array which is bounded by $23$.
