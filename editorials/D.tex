There can be only 26 clowders. We can use this information. First, lets process
all the event in the ascending order of $R_i$. We then process the cats from left
to right. After processing each cat we keep in memory the most recent position we 
saw a cat of clowder $C_i$. Then we process the events ended at the current position.
Because we know the last position for the clowder, we know that event will merge
clowders that have their $last\ position > L_i$. We keep the list of merged clowders
for the event in memory as well.\\
\\
For the queries, we also process them in the ascending order of $y_i$. But this time we 
iterate over the events from left to right. Since we know for an event, the clowders that
will be merged, we can generate a list of unordered $(i,j)$ pairs that will be merged for
an event. There can't be more than $\frac{25 \cdot 26}{2}$ pairs. We keep track of the last event
they were merged, similar to the previous section. Finally for an event, we process the 
queries that ended in that event. From the list of the last position of the pairs, we
can have a graph of 26 vertices. We merge vertices using union-find. Then we check the largest
merged clowder and output their size.
