First to Solve: \\
\\
For $strlen(line)$, we simply need to find the position of the first null(`\textbackslash 0') character.
The number of characters before that is the answer. If no null characters exist then
the answer would be the string length.
\\ \\
For $sizeof(line)$, cound the number of null in the string. Then the answer is:
\begin{equation*}
    string\ length - number\ of\ null\ characters + 1.
\end{equation*}
